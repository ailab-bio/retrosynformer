# retrosynformer

This repository contains the code for RetroSynformer [1].

The RetroSynFormer express the retrosynthesis task, iteratively breaking down a compound into building blocks, as a sequence-modeling problem and train a model based on the Decision Transformer. The synthesis routes are generated by iteratively predicting chemical reactions from a set of reaction templates that encode known transformations, and routes are scored during construction using a novel reward function. RetroSynFormer was trained on routes extracted from the PaRoutes dataset of patented experimental routes.


# Installation
Start by cloning this repo.
Then, create and activate the conda environment by executing the following commands at the root of the repository:
```
conda create -n retrosynformer-env python=3.11
conda activate myenv
```
Finally, use pip to intall the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


# User guide
1. Download and preprocess the dataset (2 steps, see Data)
2. Update the config file and train the data using `retrosynformer/train.py`
3. Use the trained model and `retrosynformer/predict.py` to predict retrosynthesis routes

## Data
Downlowad the PaRoutes dataset [2] from https://zenodo.org/records/7341155. 
Dataset can then be preprocessed by running the create_routes_dataset.ipynb notebook followed by process_routes.py.

## Training
- `retrosynformer/train.py`: Run to train the Decicion Transformer. See `results/config.yaml` for an example config file.

## Inference
- `retrosynformer/predict.py`: Run to predict routes for the testset and the N1 and N5 sets.

## Evaluation
- `retrosynformer/utils/evaluation_average.py`: Run to evaluate the results and calculate an average for multiple runs.

- `retrosynformer/utils/evalutaion_compare_aizy.py`: Run to evaluate the results and compare predictions to routes generated by baseline (AiZynthFinder [3]).
